## UW data-512 Autumn 2020 coursework

This notebook(data-512-a1.ipynb) contains instructions to produce a visualiztion showing english wikipedia traffic by pageview count and legacy pagecount data gathered from the wikipedia api (https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/Legacy_data/get_metrics_legacy_pagecounts_aggregate_project_access_site_granularity_start_end). 

The pageviews counts were filtered to only show traffic from users.

The API set up code in the notebook is borrowed with permission from a notebook: (https://public.paws.wmcloud.org/User:Jtmorgan/data512_a1_example.ipynb) by Brandon Martin-Anderson (bmander@uw.edu)

All other work is original

The included one CSV and five JSON files exist to help with repoducabliity; the notebook will generate these files when run.

There is a png of the visualization to show expected output of the notebook.

Send questions about the notebook to jm888@uw.edu
